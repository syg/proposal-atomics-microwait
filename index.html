  <h1><span class="secnum">1</span> Atomics.pause ( [ <var>N</var> ] )</h1>
  <p>This method performs the following steps when called:</p>
  <emu-alg><ol><li>If <var>N</var> is neither <emu-val>undefined</emu-val> nor an <emu-xref href="#integral-number"><a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#integral-number">integral Number</a></emu-xref>, throw a <emu-val>TypeError</emu-val> exception.</li><li>If the execution environment of the ECMAScript implementation supports signaling to the operating system or CPU that the current executing code is in a spin-wait loop, such as executing a <code>pause</code> CPU instruction, send that signal. When <var>N</var> is not <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>, it determines the number of times that signal is sent. The number of times the signal is sent for an <emu-xref href="#integral-number"><a href="https://tc39.es/ecma262/#integral-number">integral Number</a></emu-xref> <var>N</var> is less than or equal to the number times it is sent for <var>N</var> + 1 if both <var>N</var> and <var>N</var> + 1 have the same sign.</li><li>Return <emu-val>undefined</emu-val>.</li></ol></emu-alg>
  <emu-note><span class="note">Note 1</span><div class="note-contents">
    <p>This method is designed for programs implementing spin-wait loops, such as spinlock fast paths inside of mutexes, to provide a hint to the CPU that it is spinning while waiting on a value. It has no observable behaviour other than timing.</p>
    <p>Implementations are expected to implement a pause or yield instruction if the best practices of the underlying architecture recommends such instructions in spin loops. For example, the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/content-details/671488/intel-64-and-ia-32-architectures-optimization-reference-manual-volume-1.html">Intel Optimization Manual</a> recommends the <code>pause</code> instruction.</p>
  </div></emu-note>
  <emu-note><span class="note">Note 2</span><div class="note-contents">
    <p>The <var>N</var> parameter controls how long an implementation pauses. Larger values result in longer waits. Implementations are encouraged to have an internal upper bound on the maximum amount of time paused on the order of tens to hundreds of nanoseconds.</p>
    <p>The user, if passing the <var>N</var> parameter, can use it to implement backoff strategies. For backoff strategies where subsequent waits become longer, linear backoff can be implemented by passing linearly increasing values for non-negative <var>N</var>; exponential backoff can be implemented by exponentially increasing values for non-negative <var>N</var>, and so on. For backoff strategies where subsequent waits become shorter, linear backoff can be implemented by passing linearly decreasing values for negative <var>N</var>; exponential backoff where subsequent waits become longer can be implemented by exponentially decreasing values for negative <var>N</var>, and so on.</p>
  </div></emu-note>
  <emu-note><span class="note">Note 3</span><div class="note-contents">
    <p>Due to the overhead of function calls, it is reasonable that an inlined call to this method in an optimizing compiler waits a different amount of time than a non-inlined call.</p>
